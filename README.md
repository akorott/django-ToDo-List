# django-ToDo-List

I created this app to practice using the Django web framework. The app is deployed on Heroku and has a fully functioning database connected through Amazon Web Services. The app requires a user to first create a username/password which then can be used to login. After logging in, a user has the option to add/remove items, as well as to either delete or cross out items from the list.
