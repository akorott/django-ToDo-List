# django-ToDo-List

I created this app to practice using the Django web framework. The app is deployed on Heroku and has a fully functioning postgreSQL database connected through Amazon Web Services. 

Functionality:
1. Create a username/password
2. Login
3. Add/delete/cross out/edit items on the list.
4. Reset your password if you forget it (a link will be emailed to the email used during registration)
