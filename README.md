# django-ToDo-List

Link: https://django-mytodolist.herokuapp.com/

I created this app to practice using Django and Bootstrap, as well as to get more familiar with HTML/CSS. The app is deployed on Heroku and has a fully functioning postgreSQL database connected through AWS. 

Functionality:
1. Create a username/password
2. Login/Logout
3. Add/delete/cross out/edit items on the list.
4. Reset your password if you forget it (a link will be emailed to the email used during registration)
